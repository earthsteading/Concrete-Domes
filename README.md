# Concrete-Domes
This is a series of checklists for surrveying and inspecting concrete steel reinforced domes and arches for use in buildings, primarily domestic homes but applicable to commerical classes of buildings as well.


## Definitions, standards, legislation and history
The largest and longest standing (unreinfroced) dome is the Pantheon 'rotunda' in Rome, which weighs 4535 tonnes (just short on 1m pounds or 5m kilograms) and has a diameter of 43.3 meters.  The weight of the dome is supported by 8 arches (a barrel vault) which are 6.4 metres thick at the base and decrease in weight to the apex where they are 1.2 metres thick.  It is estimated that the concrete has a compressive strength of 20MPa, with varying aggregate used throughout to decrease load leading to the oculus.

  - [ ] dome: large hemispherical, segmental or pointed vault erected over a circular or polygonal base; generally over the crossing of a church.
  - [ ] concrete: cylinder compressive strength of 20-120 MPa within 28 days, with a saturated surface dry density between 1800-2800 kgm3.
  - [ ] ductility class: designation relating to the ductility of reinforcement (‘L’ designates ‘low’, ‘N’ designates ‘normal’, ‘E’ designates ‘earthquake’)
  - [ ] fitment: reinforced steel grades (between 500-800 MPa) used to reinforce longitudal spans (carry shear, torsion and diagonal tension), or provide confinement to the core concrete.

# Checklists
The following checklist is required for drawings and specifications for concrete structures:
  - [ ] Reference number, date of issue and applicable design Standards
  - [ ] Imposed action (live loads) used in designs, e.g. direct (load) action and indirect action (internal deforemation constraints resulting from bending/torsion stress)
  - [ ] Determination of earthquake design category
  - [ ] Exposure classification for durability
  - [ ] Fire resistence level (FRL)
  - [ ] Class, grade designation and properties of concrete
  - [ ] The curing procedure
  - [ ] Grade, ductility class and type of reinforcement and grade for type of tendons, i.e. regions where me
  - [ ] Size, quantity and location of all reinforcement tendons and structural fixings and the cover to each.
  - [ ] Location and details of any splices, mechanical connections and welding of any reinforcement tendons
  - [ ] Maximum jacking force for each tendon and order in which tendons are to be stressed
  - [ ] The shape and size of each member
  - [ ] The finish and method of control for unformed surfaces
  - [ ] Class of formwork as per AS3610
  - [ ] Minimum period of time after placing of concrete before stripping of forms and removal of shores
  - [ ] Location and details of planned construction and movement joints, and the method of their protection.

The following checklist is requirements for placement reinforcement tendons prior to pouring concrete:
 - [ ] Axis distance of longitudal bars to surface exposure to resist fire: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/224170036-48993bce-c36e-4172-97b1-9fda1658aadf.png)
 - [ ] Fire Resistance Periods (FRPs) for structural adequacy of columns: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/224170212-89683b74-c97b-41bf-9de0-b0e5b3d80bfc.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/224170348-7b139368-0267-4e1d-9d93-e152c428b97e.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/224170542-732afd5d-0b45-4078-8e2f-dfc1c257ac86.png)
