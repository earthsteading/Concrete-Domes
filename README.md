# Concrete-Domes
This is a series of checklists for surrveying and inspecting concrete steel reinforced domes and arches for use in buildings, primarily domestic homes but applicable to commerical classes of buildings as well.


## Definitions, standards, legislation and history
The largest and longest standing (unreinfroced) dome is the Pantheon 'rotunda' in Rome, which weighs 4535 tonnes (just short on 1m pounds or 5m kilograms) and has a diameter of 43.3 meters.  The weight of the dome is supported by 8 arches (a barrel vault) which are 6.4 metres thick at the base and decrease in weight to the apex where they are 1.2 metres thick.  It is estimated that the concrete has a compressive strength of 20MPa, with varying aggregate used throughout to decrease load leading to the oculus.
